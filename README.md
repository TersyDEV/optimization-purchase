# optimization-purchase
<h1>Description</h1>
This is a code written in MATLAB language which I wrote after my studies of Operations Research during the 2nd year of my Bachelor Degree. It's a simple scalable code that focuses on optimizing the purchase of a given set of items.
It can optimize the total spending for anything that has to be bought, the main goal is to help the decision-making process of choosing where to buy partial or complete sets of items given every shop with its prices and shipping costs.
