# optimization-purchase
<h1>Description</h1>
This is a code written in MATLAB language which I wrote after my studies of Operations Research during the 2nd year of my Bachelor Degree. It's a simple scalable code that focuses on optimizing the purchase of a given set of items.</br></br>
It can optimize the total spending for anything that has to be bought, the main goal is to help the decision-making process of choosing where to buy partial or complete sets of items given every shop with its prices and shipping costs.
<h1>How to use</h1>
<strong>Read Carefully</strong> To run the code, your MATLAB enviroment <strong>has</strong> to include the following toolboxes: <strong>"Optimization Toolbox" "Global Optimization Toolbox"</strong></br>
The main function takes as input a String containing the name of a data folder located in the same path of the executable function. This folder <strong>has to contain 3 csv files</strong> called "shipping.csv", "demand.csv" and "shoprice.csv".
